Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing

Reagan,

Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

Subject: closing



Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?

George,

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Phillip

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

George,

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

Phillip Allen

 I need to see the site plan for Burnet.  Remember I must get written 
approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has 
concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.    I would also like 
to review the closing statements as soon as possible.

Brenda,

 I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on 
August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I 
will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can 
treat the 2nd as payment for October.

 I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without 
getting the details and getting your approval.

 I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Jeff,

 I received the rent roll.  I am going to be in San Marcos this weekend but I 
am booked with stage coach.  I will drive by Friday evening.
 I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.  Can you find out 
when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price?

 What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal.  Remember 
we have to get Brenda happy.

Jeff,

 You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood. 

  I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which  
I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering 
properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you 
perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a 
project from scratch?

 I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.

I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.
Sincerely,
George W. Richards

Larry,

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."" 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way.""

We have not received your completed Team Selection information.  It is
imperative that we receive your team's information (email, phone number,
office) asap.  We cannot start your administration without this information,
and your raters will have less time to provide feedback for you.

Thank you for your assistance.

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

 Compare your california production to the numbers in the 2000 California Gas 
Report.  It shows 410.  But again that might be just what the two utilities

Subject: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence Program


Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

Mark,

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any 
questions.

Phillip

Brad,

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial 
manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an 
associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end.  

 Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.

 Let me know if there are any issues.

Lucy,

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

Lucy,

 We can discuss your email later.  How is progress on creating the 
spreadsheets.  You will probably need to close the file before you attach to 
an email.  It is 2:00.  I really want to make some progress on these two

Open the ""utility"" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it 
is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1).
You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.  If we 
have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper.  Use the rates 
described in the spreadsheet.  This is a great chance for you to practice 
excel.

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all of the ""stupid regulatory/legislative decisions"" since the beginning of the year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next week's ""Ken Lay Tour"" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?

Mac,

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

I checked into exercising options with Smith Barney, but Enron has some kind 
of exclusive with Paine Weber.  I am starting to exercise now, but I am going 
to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex.   
 What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI?
 Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.

Thanks,

Subject: TRANSPORTATION MODEL

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

Lucy,

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the ""Checkbook"" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

Phillip

can you build something to look at historical prices from where we saved 
curves each night.

Here is an example that pulls socal only.
Improvements could include a drop down menu to choose any curve and a choice

Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Thanks, Mike

Wade,

 I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle 
situation.  You need to take care of it this week.  Lucy can't hold the 
tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers) 
if the staff doesn't live up to it.  If you decide to buy a small truck and 
you want to list me as an employer for credit purposes, I will vouch for your 
income.

Tim,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?

Thank you,

Phillip",kaggle,,

Mike--

Here are the net open Socal border positions we have for Elvis and Cactus.  
Let's try and set up a conference call with Phillip and John to talk about 
their offers at the back-end of their curves.

Roughly speaking, we are looking at a nominal 3750 MMBtu/d for 14 years from 
May 2010 on Elvis, and 3000 MMBtu/d on Cactus fromJune 2004 to April 2022.

Hey Phillip,
I received your note from Celeste.  I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator and 
need for you to fill out the attached Needs Assessment form before I can send 
you any resumes.  Also, would you be interested in the new class?  Analysts 
start with the business units on Aug. 3rd and Assoc. start on Aug. 28th.  We 
are starting to place the Associates and would like to see if you are 
interested.  Please let me know.  

Once I receive the Needs Assessment back (and you let me know if you can wait 
a month,) I will be happy to pull a couple of resumes for your review.  If 
you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Hi Assan 👋

Assan Sanogo <assansanogo@gmail.com>

Wed, Aug 24, 2022 at 11:53 AM

We're getting close to the launch date for the new AWS Certified Solutions Architect
Associate SAA-C03 exam. In fact, registration is now open for the SAA-C03 and the
SAA-C02 expires on the 29th of August.

That means that (unless you're taking your exam in the next few days) you will be taking
the SAA-C03 exam. But don't stress! We've got you covered and have already been
working hard to update our video courses and practice test courses based on the
new exam guide.

To access the latest training resources for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate at
the best price, visit: digitalcloud.training/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/

If you're already enrolled in our training and have an active subscription, you'll
automatically get access to all updates at no additional cost!

You'll notice lots of new videos with [SAA-C03] at the beginning of the lesson title -
these are topics from the new exam guide that may show up in your exam - so make
sure you watch those videos.

For the practice tests we have already made some updates and many new questions
will be released both before and after the SAA-C03 exam goes live. We'll let you know in
our Slack channel when we release new questions.

We'll also be updating our Training Notes (ebook) soon to reflect the latest changes.  

For more info, check out the following resources:

Architect Associate

Indian IT has been badly affected by a high rate of attrition. Many

companies struggle to add more talent to meet the required demand.

Despite several efforts, including a record number of fresher hiring,

bonuses, ESOPs, salary hikes and others, the employee churn is refusing to

come down or be under control. 

https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=8e82d7cdd1&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f%3A1741244913794831618&simpl=msg-f%3A1741244913794831618

As per AIM estimates, the average attrition rate of Indian IT companies

stands at 24 per cent . For instance, Cognizant has the highest attrition rate

at 31 per cent (FY22 Q2). This is followed by Infosys, Happiest Minds,

HCL Technologies, Wipro and others for the ﬁrst quarter of FY23. 

Recently, one of the analysts has demanded to do a rain check on the

company’s underperformance and possibly even consider replacing

Cognizant chief Brain Humphries. 

Tech Mahindra is one of the few IT ﬁrms to have witnessed a decline in

attrition, where it saw a 2 per cent drop compared to the previous quarter.

But, the attrition rate is still higher compared to FY22 Q1, which stood at

17 per cent .

Revenue-wise , Infosys is ahead of most of its peers, showcasing 21.4 per

cent year-on-year (YoY) growth, followed by Tech Mahindra and Wipro

with 18 per cent and 17.2 per cent revenue growth, respectively. 

At the same time, the rising attrition rate is not stopping Indian IT from

going on a hiring spree. While most IT companies focus on campus hires,

very few are looking at off-campus hiring. 

Happiest Minds looks to hire about 500 campus graduates in the

upcoming quarter, with about 300 expected to join the team in August.

Happiest Minds noted a moderate pace in hiring off-campus candidates

and lesser experienced people in the current quarter. 

In FY22 Q2, Cognizant added about 900 employees, totalling an employee

headcount of 3,41,100. In addition, the company plans to make 55,000

offers to new graduates in India in 2022.

TCS is also hiring aggressively. In FY23 Q1, the company crossed the 600K

mark, ending this quarter with 6,06,331 employees. “We continue to hire

talent from across the world with a net addition of 14,136,” said Samir

Seksaria , CFO at TCS.

Comparison of Ultrasound Image Classiﬁer Deep Learning
Algorithms for Shrapnel Detection

Surgical Research, Ft. Sam Houston, TX 78234, USA; emily.n.boice.ctr@mail.mil (E.N.B.);

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is essential in emergency medicine and combat casualty care, often-
times used as a critical triage tool. However, identifying injuries, such as shrapnel embedded in
tissue or a pneumothorax, can be challenging without extensive ultrasonography training, which may
not be available in prolonged ﬁeld care or emergency medicine scenarios. Artiﬁcial intelligence can
simplify this by automating image interpretation but only if it can be deployed for use in real time.
We previously developed a deep learning neural network model speciﬁcally designed to identify
shrapnel in ultrasound images, termed ShrapML. Here, we expand on that work to further optimize
the model and compare its performance to that of conventional models trained on the ImageNet
database, such as ResNet50. Through Bayesian optimization, the model’s parameters were further
reﬁned, resulting in an F1 score of 0.98. We compared the proposed model to four conventional
models: DarkNet-19, GoogleNet, MobileNetv2, and SqueezeNet which were down-selected based on
speed and testing accuracy. Although MobileNetv2 achieved a higher accuracy than ShrapML, there
was a tradeoff between accuracy and speed, with ShrapML being 10× faster than MobileNetv2. In
conclusion, real-time deployment of algorithms such as ShrapML can reduce the cognitive load for
medical providers in high-stress emergency or miliary medicine scenarios.

Keywords: deep learning; ultrasound imaging; image interpretation; artiﬁcial intelligence; shrapnel;
military medicine; emergency medicine

1. Introduction

Ultrasound (US) imaging is commonly used in medicine for its nondestructive testing
capabilities and real-time assessment value. One such example is the detection of foreign
bodies during emergency medicine assessments due to its high accuracy, instrument
portability, and modest power requirements [1–3]. Higher-resolution imaging modalities
(CT, MRI, etc.) are preferred for diagnosis in hospital settings, but this is typically not
possible in remote settings, such as combat casualty care. In addition, acquisition and
interpretation of US images can only be effective if the end user is trained in sonography
and anatomy. This can be a technically challenging process, requiring hours of training.

Algorithms for ultrasound imaging diagnostics were developed for a range of use
cases, such as detecting tumors [4], thyroid nodules [5], and lung pathologies in COVID-19
patients [6]. These types of algorithms primarily rely on supervised deep learning convolu-
tional neural networks (CNNs) to identify trends in image sets. More advanced algorithms
can utilize object detection or segmentation approaches to highlight precise regions in
the US image ﬁeld as abnormal [7] or be used in real time [8–10]. The use of artiﬁcial-
intelligence-guided diagnostics would enable faster, higher accuracy assessments, which
could be critical in resource- and personnel-limited, high-stress environments, such as
battleﬁeld trauma scenarios.

We previously developed [11,12] and tested a deep learning model (ShrapML) for
the automated detection of shrapnel. ShrapML is an image classiﬁcation model trained

on ultrasound images of both gelatin tissue phantoms and porcine tissue. When tested
with ultrasound images for external validation, ShrapML makes binary predictions as to
whether shrapnel is present in the image, with an overall accuracy of 95%, an F1 score of
0.95, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.95.

Other existing algorithms have conventionally been trained with the ImageNet dataset [13]
to determine thousands of category types. These algorithms can be computationally
intensive and require millions of images for training. Such algorithms include VGG16 [14],
EfﬁcientNet [15], and InceptionNet [16–18], among others. Although the ImageNet dataset
is extensive, it is focused on everyday objects that are not relevant to medical imaging.
Through transfer learning, these models can be used on new medical imaging datasets
and compared for accuracy. As high accuracy with lower computational power needs will
be ideal for incorporating image analysis algorithms into existing ultrasound hardware,
here, we enhance the ShrapML classiﬁer using Bayesian optimization and then compare its
performance to that of conventional, well-established image classiﬁer algorithms using an
expanded US shrapnel dataset.

2. Materials and Methods

CNN models can achieve human-like accuracies in image classiﬁcation problems due
to their self-learning and superior classiﬁcation abilities. A CNN network is typically
comprised of a chain of organized components: convolution layers (Conv) with activation
functions, max pooling layers (Pool), and batch normalization operations. The hierarchical
network structure provides high-level feature maps, reduced computational complexity,
and improved generalization ability.

2.1. ShrapML Architecture

Previous work from the laboratory outlines the full architecture of the ShrapML
classiﬁer algorithm [11]. In short, the algorithm was built using TensorFlow/Keras libraries
and Jupyter Notebook in Python. Red-green-blue (RGB) ultrasound images were used as
an input for this algorithm and resized. Images were augmented by random ﬂip, rotation,
zoom, and contrast processes, and this dataset was used to train the model. The model
consisted of a series of 5 repeated successions of Conv with ReLu activators and Pool layers
with increasing ﬁlter size. This was followed by a dropout layer, a ﬂatten layer, and, ﬁnally,
a dense layer with sigmoid activation. This model was trained over 100 epochs using
RMSprop optimizer to minimize validation loss. When testing this model with externally
validated images, the model predicted whether an image was positive or negative for
shrapnel and gave a conﬁdence value of its prediction.

2.2. Bayesian Optimzation Setup

For optimization of the hyperparameters in ShrapML, beyond the initial iterative
approach, we used Bayesian optimization. This is a widely used approach to remove
human bias from the model optimization aspect and evaluate hyperparameters with a
probabilistic approach [19–22]. ShrapML was set up to optimize 5 hyperparameters of
the model (Table 1). The CNN size and layers were set up such that the size of the next
layer was a product of the CNN size and layer number for each additional layer (4, 8, 12,
or 16 ﬁlters for a 4-layer model, for instance). The phantom image sets used to originally
develop ShrapML were used as training and validation datasets during optimization.
A total of 10 epochs were performed for each iteration, with the goal of optimizing the
problem set to minimize validation loss. Bayesian optimization was set up using the
experiment manager application in MATLAB R2021b (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) and
was concluded after 250 trials were evaluated. Optimization was performed on an HP
workstation (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) running Windows 10 Pro (Microsoft,

2.3. Ultrasound Phantom Development

A previously published gelatin tissue phantom [12] was modiﬁed for use in this
work. In short, a 3D-printed mold was designed with human adult male thigh dimensions,
including three major components: a 3D-printed bone, a muscle layer, and a fat layer.
For the construction of the muscle and fat layers, a 10% (w/v) gelatin (Thermo-Fisher,
Waltham, MA, USA) solution was prepared using a 2:1 solution of water and evaporated
milk (Kirkland, Seattle, WA, USA). The fat-layer gelatin solution was supplemented with
0.1% ﬂour (HEB, San Antonio, TX, USA) for increased hyperechoicity. The muscle-layer
gelatin solution was supplemented with 0.25% ﬂour and roughly chopped pieces of 2%
agarose (Sigma-Millipore, St. Louis, MO, USA) for added heterogenicity. The mold was
assembled ﬁrst for the inner layer (muscle layer). The inner layer solution was poured and
inverted repeatedly to keep the agarose pieces distributed as the phantom solidiﬁed. After
approximately 30 min, the inner layer stiffened and was placed in the outer-layer mold.
The second layer (outer fat layer) was poured around the inner layer and chilled at 4 ◦C.
After solidiﬁcation, the completed tissue phantom was removed from the mold and used
for US imaging applications.

2.4. Ultrasound Image Collection and Processing

After the tissue phantom was created, ultrasound images were collected using a
Sonosite Edge (Fujiﬁlm Sonosite, Bothell, WA, USA) and HFL50 ultrasound transducer
(Fujiﬁlm Sonosite, Bothell, WA, USA). To avoid air interference, all phantom imaging was
performed underwater. Baseline data were collected prior to shrapnel insertion of the
entire phantom using 10 s B-mode clips. For shrapnel, we previously determined that
ShrapML performed similarly with different material types, so a single material type of
varying length was used for this study [11]. A 2.5 mm diameter brass rod was cut to 2, 4,
6, 8, or 10 mm length fragments to provide a range of shrapnel sizes (Figure 1). The brass
pieces were then inserted to varying depths within the phantom in the four quadrants
using surgical forceps, and shrapnel-positive data were collected with 10 s B-mode clips.
Ultrasound video clips were transferred from the imaging device, and frames were
extracted from the clips using the ffmpeg-Ruby tool (version 4.4). Duplicate frames were
removed from the dataset, as the US clips had a high frames-per-second rate, resulting in
four duplicates for every new frame. Individual images where then sorted into ground
truth groups: shrapnel (positive) and baseline (negative). Any image for which it was
uncertain as to which group it belonged to was discarded and not used in the training
dataset. Next, images were cropped and standardized to remove the settings, ﬁle name,
and miscellaneous US information included in the exported frames, followed by conversion
to 16 bit and resizing to 512 × 512. All image processing operations were performed using
the batch image processing toolkit in MATLAB R2021b. In total, three different phantoms
were imaged, resulting in approximately 6600 baseline and 6700 shrapnel images.

sizes—2 mm (B), 4 mm (C), 6 mm (D), 8 mm (E), and 10 mm (F)—acquired in the gelatin phantom.

2.5. Model Training Overview

Model training was performed for three separate experiments detailed below. Speciﬁc
differences for each experiment are detailed in each subsection. First, shrapnel and baseline
images were subsplit into three groups: 60% training, 20% validation, and 20% testing.
Training images were augmented in an attempt to prevent overﬁtting by applying up to
±20% zoom to each image, ± 360 degrees of rotation, and mirroring across the x or y axis.
This was done randomly for each image prior to training. Validation images used during
training runs were not augmented, nor were testing images. During training, 100 epochs
were used unless otherwise speciﬁed, with a learning rate of 0.001. All training was
performed using MATLAB R2021b with the deep learning and machine learning toolboxes.

2.5.1. Bayesian-Optimized ShrapML Model Evaluation

Training was performed after Bayesian optimization with the new phantom images.
All training was performed on an HP workstation (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA)
running Windows 10 Pro (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and an Intel Xeon W-2123
(3.6 GHz, 4 core, Santa Clara, CA, USA) processor with 64 GB RAM using an NVIDIA
Quatro p1000 (4GB VRAM, Santa Clara, CA, USA) GPU with an image batch size of
32 images.

2.5.2. Comparison to Conventional Image Classiﬁcation Models

In order to compare the performance of the Bayesian-optimized ShrapML to that of
additional classiﬁers, a literature review was conducted, considering studies published
in the last ten years, to identify 11 classiﬁers that had previous uses either with ultra-
sound image datasets or in real-time applications. These classiﬁers are shown in Table 2,
which highlights the differences between the complexities in the algorithms by identifying
architectural details and the number of parameters.

These additional 11 classiﬁer algorithms were imported into the MATLAB R2021b
deep learning toolbox. Input and output layers were adjusted to meet the 512 × 512 image
input size and the 2 class types (baseline and shrapnel), respectively. The processed datasets
(see Section 2.4) were used for transfer learning with these pretrained models. To identify
the highest-accuracy candidates from this original group of 12 models (ShrapML plus 11
conventional classiﬁers), the models were trained in short runs using 5 epochs, a training
image subset of 200 images, and a batch size of 10. Training was performed using CPU
on an HP workstation (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) running Windows 10 Pro
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and an Intel Xeon W-2123 (3.6 GHz, 4 core, Santa Clara,
CA, USA) processor with 64 GB RAM. After transfer learning occurred on these new models,
an isolated dataset was used to test the model and quantify the performance metrics.

2.5.3. Robust Model Evaluation

After initial model evaluation, the performance metrics were gauged for highest
accuracy and lowest training time, which generated a ranking for each model. The top
5 models were selected for robust training. All subsequent training was performed on
an HP workstation (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) running Windows 10 Pro
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X (3.8 GHz, 6 core, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) processor with 32 GB RAM using a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super
(8 GB VRAM, Santa Clara, CA, USA) GPU with an image batch size of 16 images. The
same datasets as those used in the initial evaluation were used again for transfer learning
and testing.

2.6. Performance Metrics

Test-set predictions were performed for each trained model using 20% of the full
dataset, which was reserved prior to training. A table of ground truth labels, class pre-
dictions, and conﬁdences was generated with all the predictions, which was used for
backend analysis of the model’s performance. Confusion matrices were constructed to
distinguish true-positive, false-positive, true-negative, and false-negative results. Accuracy,
precision, recall, speciﬁcity, and F1 score were calculated for each model. ROC curves and
the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were also generated. Analyses were performed using

J. Imaging 2022, 8, 140

MATLAB R2021b, and confusion matrix graphics were created using GraphPad Prism 9
(San Diego, CA, USA). For comparison to other classiﬁer models, the training and testing
time was measured for each model to assess relative speeds.

3. Results
3.1. Bayesian Optimization of ShrapML

We iteratively and selectively developed ShrapML for use in ultrasound image clas-
siﬁcation in previous studies; however, it was not thoroughly optimized. To this end,
250 Bayesian optimization iterations were performed across six key hyperparameters
shown in Table 1. The three top-performing models from this exercise, along with other
representative models, are shown in Table 3. For comparison, the selected performance
and hyperparameters are also shown from the original ShrapML model. Overall, Bayesian
optimization was able to identify higher-performing models than the original ShrapML.

Table 3. Summary of results of the Bayesian optimization of ShrapML. Iterations 33, 83, and 71
were the three highest-performing iterations, based on validation loss. Iterations 231 and 74 were
representative medium- and poor-performing iterations. The last column was results for 10 epochs
of training from the original ShrapML model. The single-color heat map indicates best-performing
models in green, with the worst being uncolored for each performance metric row.

Performance was evaluated in three ways: validation accuracy, validation loss, and
training time. Training time was considered a factor of computational burden of the model
for potential real-time or near-real-time deployment in real-world applications. In general,
a larger fully connected layer at the end of the model and more CNN layers resulted
in better performance. The highest-performing model reached 50% lower loss than the
original ShrapML, although that performance improvement was paired with four times
the training time compared to iterations 83 and 71. As a result, iteration 83 was selected as
the optimal version, as it achieved similar validation performance with a much quicker
operation vs. iteration 33. The exact architecture of the optimized hyperparameters within
ShrapML is shown in Figure 2.

Next, the optimized network was trained with the entire dataset, which included more
than 13,000 images and 100 training epochs, in order to reﬁne the model weights. The false-
positive rate was slightly higher than the false-negative rate, but both rates remained low
(Figure 3A). The ROC curve for the optimized model is shown in Figure 3B. Backend testing
resulted in 97% accuracy, with an F1 score and AUC of 0.9765 and 0.9985, respectively
(Table 4). Compared to the original ShrapML results [11], accuracy, F1, and AUC were
95%, 0.95, and 0.95, respectively. These represent only slight improvements, although the
optimized model was trained on a much larger phantom image set with 10× the number
of images when compared to the original ShrapML model results.

3.2. Comparison to Others Models

Next, we evaluated how ShrapML compared to conventional image classiﬁers that
have been extensively evaluated using ImageNet. Initially, 11 models were selected, which
were, along with ShrapML, trained for ﬁve epochs with a reduced dataset of 200 images as
an initial streamlined comparison (Table 5). The models were evaluated based on two key
performance metrics: test prediction accuracy and training time. The best-performing mod-
els based on prediction accuracy were ResNet101 and VGG16, which reached 0.83 accuracy.
Others, including ShrapML, surpassed 0.75 in ﬁve epochs. Although VGG16 achieved the
highest accuracy, it took over an hour to complete training, whereas other models, such
as SqueezeNet and ShrapML, took less than 5 min. For this reason, both test accuracy
and training time were used to down select, with ﬁve models retained for further training:
DarkNet19, GoogleNet, MobileNetv2, ShrapML, and SqueezeNet.

Performance comparison of the ﬁve down-selected models consisted of more robust
training using 100 epochs and the full image dataset (13.3k images). Confusion matrices
were compared, and all models showed high true-positive and true-negative rates, with
MobileNetv2 having the lowest overall false-positive and false-negative rates of the ﬁve
models (Figure 4A–E). MobileNetv2 was the best-performing model based on the traditional
performance metrics, such as accuracy and F1 score, whereas SqueezeNet had the worst
performance (Table 6). However, the difference between Mobile and ShrapML for accuracy
and F1 score was 0.032 (Mobile, 0.998 vs. ShrapML, 0.966) and 0.031 (Mobile 0.999 vs.
ShrapML 0.967), respectively. This is a minor difference in contrast to inference time, where
ShrapML processed testing images in 10.2 milliseconds (ms), whereas Mobile required
104 ms—a 10× difference. In conclusion, ShrapML strikes a balance between standard
performance metrics and performance speed, which may be optimal in certain real-time
imaging applications.

Ultrasound imaging has a growing value in medical diagnostics, especially when a
quick, accurate assessment is needed. Scenarios such as this often happen in emergency
medicine and combat casualty care. Trained personnel are required for image interpretation
and are commonly not readily available in remote environments. By lowering the cognitive
burden and developing automated detection of shrapnel, medical imaging becomes acces-
sible in these extreme environments. Here, we describe the Bayesian optimization of the
existing ShrapML classiﬁer algorithm and its comparison to other conventional classiﬁers
trained using the ImageNet archive.

Identiﬁcation of an algorithm with high accuracy and lower computational power
needs will enable integration into various US hardware units for use in such austere
environments. As US instrument size shrinks, in some cases to the size of a cellular
phone, it becomes ever more critical that this minimal computational power threshold
is maintained.

Bayesian optimization of ShrapML improved accuracy to 97%. Conventional classi-fier algorithms were used to evaluate the performance of transfer learning with ultra-sound image sets. These conventional algorithms had millions more parameters and were expected to outperform the smaller ShrapML in terms of accuracy in detecting features because of their additional complexity and size. This was not the case. ShrapML’s accu-racy was proven to rival that of the other models, completing training and testing in a fraction of the time compared to conventional algorithms. However, MobileNetv2 and other models with millions of trainable parameters can result in better performance if the highest possible accuracy and F1 score are essential. For triage applications, such as those required in emergency medicine, the tradeoff between speed and accuracy may tip further in the speed direction when compared to AI-focused assistance with a surgical operation [33,34] or identification of a tumor’s precise tissue boundary [35]. There are some limitations of the current work and scope. First, more diversity in the phantom design may be needed to further reduce the possibility of overfitting. This prob-lem can be addressed with future testing or with more robust data augmentation, such as mixup [36–38]. Second, the phantom is limited in its complexity when compared to real tissue.

There are some limitations of the current work and scope. First, more diversity in
the phantom design may be needed to further reduce the possibility of overﬁtting. This
problem can be addressed with future testing or with more robust data augmentation,
such as mixup [36–38]. Second, the phantom is limited in its complexity when compared
to real tissue. Although it may be complex in terms of ultrasound properties, it lacks
tissue or-organ-level organization, as well as vessels with pulsatile ﬂow. Next steps should
consider transfer learning of the optimal models with animal datasets to improve the
training complexity with a more relevant dataset. Third, only shrapnel detection was
evaluated in the present study. This was selected as a simple initial use case with a high
triage need in military applications; however, more widely used is the extended Focus
Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (eFAST) examination procedure for detection of
pneumothorax or abdominal hemorrhage. With the identiﬁcation of an optimal classiﬁer
model, shrapnel detection algorithms can eventually be used in eFAST applications, as the
same models and principles showcased here can apply.

Next steps for this work will involve transitioning this work into real-time use cases
paired with ultrasound imaging. Streamed ultrasound video footage will need to be
evaluated to determine whether the compression requirements for video streaming impact
model performance. Integration of AI models with tablets or small microcontrollers will
also be essential when moving to real time to eliminate the need for a large computer
in military or remote medicine situations. Further next steps will look at modiﬁcations
of this model for use in object detection to precisely locate the foreign body placement
instead of only classiﬁcation. These next steps, along with models optimized for speed and
ultrasound imaging, will help to reduce the cognitive load of image interpretation during
high-stress, emergency medicine situations.

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, artiﬁcial intelligence has the potential to improve medical imaging
with an appropriate model for a given application. For ultrasound imaging in military
and austere environments where resources are limited and high-level triage is the primary
goal, simple deep learning models with rapid inference times may be ideal for real-time
deployment. The ShrapML algorithm, which we further optimized in this work, is suited
for the speciﬁc task of rapidly identifying shrapnel much faster than conventional deep
learning models. This model will be integrated for use in real time going forward and

Learn how to collect and analyze environmental data with drones

Drones technology is creating a new realm of possibilities for environmental

research and data science in the world today, with the drones market projected to

veteran drone pilots, and data scientists. Each course in the program is 6 to 7

weeks long, comprising video lessons, practical learning activities, a weekly 1.5

hour live class session with course instructors, and opportunities to engage with the

instructors and fellow course participants in the course’s group chat platform.

Program overview

Here is an overview of the program’s 3 non-credit courses:

October 3 - November 11, 2022: Introduction to UAS in Biology, Ecology,

and Conservation. Discover the foundations of revolutionary drone technology

and determine how drones can be applied in research, including your own. 

January 9 - February 17, 2023: UAS Operations for Environmental

Scientists. Become a scientist pilot by learning the basics of drone flight

operations, how to become legally certified, and how to fly effectively for

scientific research purposes.
